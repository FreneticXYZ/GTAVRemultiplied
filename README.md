A fanciful high-hopes mod for Grand Theft Auto V

More information coming soon!

### Installing From Release

- Download the release .zip file, extract its contents to a folder
- Download the file at http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/ and include the files ScriptHookV.dll and dinput8.dll in your folder created by the first step
- Run InstallGTAVRMP.exe, click "Find It" at the top right, and click your GTA5.exe file, where that is (Wherever you installed GTAV, EG in `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Grand Theft Auto V/GTA5.exe`)
- Click "Install GTAV RMP"
- You are now ready to play!

### Installing From Source (Manual)

- Install http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/ using their resources.
- Install https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases using their resources or the copy contained in this source.
- Build this project from the source available here, using Visual Studio 2015 (or acquire the dll's from a release copy).
- Copy the resultant dll's (GTAVRemultiplied, YAMLDotNet, FreneticScript) of this project's build into your `GTAV/scripts/` folder.
- You are now ready to play!

### Notes to GTAV-RMP developers

- Be careful handling object hashes. They are `UInt32`s on the inside (32-bit unsigned integers), but are converted by ScriptHookVDotNet to `Int32`s (32-bit SIGNED integers).
	- Because of this, if you have a PedHash or VehicleHash or similar and want to treat it as the same as a model hash (IE, as an int), send it through the `Model` class.
		- This can be done, for example, with the following: `Model DefaultModel = PedHash.DeadHooker; if (myHash == DefaultModel.Hash) ...`
- It is technically possible to just send raw function call data across the network, due to its design. However, NEVER do this. It gives too much power to the packet creator!
- We can call any function we want in any form we want, and you are free to do so. However, where there is a pre-implemented method or property available, please use that instead.
	- For example: while we could use `Function.Call<Vector3>(GET_ENTITY_VELOCITY, ped.Handle)`, we should instead use `ped.Velocity`.
- We're missing a lot of control here. We gotta just make do with what we got. We might end up having to somehow inject code somewhere, but let's try to avoid that.
